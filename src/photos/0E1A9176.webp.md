The final supermoon, the cold moon, of 2025. Multiple images have been stacked
to reduce noise. The image was then wavelet-sharpened to bring out details.
Saturation has been increased to bring out the colour of the moon. The different
colours are caused by the varying mineral compositions of the moon’s surface.
