      <h1>About the site</h1>
      <p>
        This site contains some of my favourite photos that I’ve taken with the
        Canon mirrorless and DSLR cameras I’ve had over the years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many images have an HDR version available when using a compatible
        Chromium-based browser, such as Chrome and Edge, with a compatible
        display (for example, most recent smartphones with an OLED screen).
      </p>
